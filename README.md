Let's take an real life example where this model stood out: Suppose HR is taking an interview and at last he ask the candidate what salary are you expecting.Candidate replied and said I should get at-least 'X' amt. of salary because that was my previous salary in my old company.Now, the company hires us a Data-Scientist and given us the work to find out whether the Candidate was speaking truth or playing bluff. So as an Data-Scientist, we collected the data for his old company (i.e salary at different positions through Glassdoor,etc) and also taking his experience into account (through LinkedIn). Now in this, using "Polynomial Linear Regression" , "Support Vector Regression" , " Decision Tree Regression" and "Random Forest Regression" we will predict the estimated salary of an newly joined employee. Since on the same dataset we are implementing different regression model,we get the fair idea of how one is different from the other. At last, we will also compare the result obtained with Linear Regression and we will get to know the importance of non Linear model as compared to Linear model.
